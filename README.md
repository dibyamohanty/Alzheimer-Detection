# Alzheimer-Detection
MATLAB code to classify Brain MRI images as Alzheimer affected or Cognitive Normal. The MRI dataset of 83 right handed female patients (18-30 years) 
was acquired from OASIS <http://www.oasis-brains.org/>. The features extracted from the MRI included ratio of the Grey Matter Volume to 
the Normalized Whole Brain Volume (nWBV), ratio of the White Matter Volume to the Volume of the Cerebrospinal Fluid and features extracted from GLCM 
like Entropy, Energy, Homogeneity and Correlation.
